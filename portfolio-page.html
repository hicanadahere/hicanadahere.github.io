			<h3>Title: SDJ - Glitch</h3>
			<p>My own take on Jack from the game 'SWWSDJ'. As players of the game know he's a yandere character in the game. So, I decided to give him a bit of a glitch effect as if he notices you through the screen.</p>

			<h3>Title: Angie the Angle of Envy</h3>
			<p>This is my Hazbin Hotel OC Angie! When she was alive in the 1950s, she wished to be the head of her family, but she had many brothers to take her place. So, she would then have to force her way to the top. That was before she was poisoned for her terrible crimes. Now she seeks redemption at the Hazbin Hotel!</p>
