For my final portfolio website I used some of the images that we had chosen to use for our portfolio in another class. These would be the works that I will feature on my site in their frames that I created through the CSS panel. This site provides some background information about my work and what I am currently doing now. It also has a form feature that allows for users to ask questions or leave comments for my site in the homepage. I also provided a link to my Gmail as well in my contact-me-page this way if there are any questions that the viewer would like to ask me personally they have a way to contact me. There are also links to the file of my animated work as well. I had a bit of trouble getting my buttons and the site available for multiple devices. Both feature should be working now as I have added to their functionality and visual appeal in the main CSS style. I had tried to add some JS animation for my portfolio pieces but I couldn't quite get them to work properly so I had to cut them out (Sadness T^T).
